## When faced with tight deadlines, you can prioritize tasks by:

### Creating a to-do list

Write down all tasks, including mundane ones, so you can get them out of your head and onto paper. 

### Assessing urgency and importance

Use a prioritization framework, like the Eisenhower Matrix, to divide tasks into quadrants based on their urgency and importance. 

### Delegating tasks

Assign tasks to team members who have the necessary skills and experience to complete them on time. 

### Eliminating distractions

Minimize interruptions by turning off notifications, closing unnecessary tabs, or finding a quiet workspace. 

### Avoiding multitasking

Create a prioritized task list for each individual so they can focus on one task at a time. 

### Communicating with your team

Collaborate with team members to discuss potential strategies and alleviate stress.

### Breaking tasks into smaller portions

Procrastination can increase stress under tight deadlines, so break tasks into smaller, more manageable portions.
